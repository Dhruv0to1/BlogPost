In this project, I have created a full fledge website on blog post where you can login, signup, create post, view others post if they have set post to active state, delete your post, and even edit it. In this project have used react hook form, to manage input states, react redux toolkit for creating store so that app doesn't need to call the api instead will call the data from store. This project uses backend service named Appwrite, which handles authorization and database. For designing have used Tailwind css.
